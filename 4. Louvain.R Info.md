Louvain clustering is a graph-based algorithm which clusters **nodes** into tightly-packed clusters called **communities**.
It does this via a repetitive iteration of modularity optimisation, followed by community aggregation, until it has
achieved _**maximum modularity**_. Modularity is a measure of _how much more / less intra-community connectivity exists 
compared to a random network_. It is denoted by Q, and Q ranges between **-0.5 < Q < 1**.

In this code, we will be using a Louvain clustering algorithm which assigns a weight to each correlation (as opposed
to simply assigning an edge). This is because, should there be a correlation between 2 patients, a weighted edge
will quantify the strength of this correlation, which will be useful in clustering the nodes into more statistically
meaningful communities. 

**How can we assign a weight to an edge?**

There are various methods we can use to assign a weight to an edge. The 2 that are most relevant are:

- Pearson Correlation coefficient
- Spearman Rank Correlation coefficient
  
The coefficient can serve as the weight of the edge, with a minimum value being set to determine whether an edge should even exist between the 2 nodes. We will be altering this minimum value.
