**Leiden Vs Louvain**

Initially, I performed this same clustering with Louvain instead of Leiden. Whilst they are both very similar, Leiden ensures that nodes within each community are even more tightly connected due to the _partition refinement_ step. Additionally, Leiden possesses a unique resolution parameter, which affects the granularity of the communities produced, which is more helpful in segregating patients based on aetiology. This is why Leiden was preferred.

**Leiden Clustering**

Leiden clustering is a graph-based algorithm which clusters **nodes** into tightly-packed clusters called **communities**.
It does this via a repetitive iteration of modularity optimisation, partition refinement, and community aggregation, until it has achieved _**maximum modularity**_. Modularity (Q) is a measure of _how much more / less intra-community connectivity exists compared to a random network_. Q ranges between **-0.5 < Q < 1**.

In this code, we will be using a Leiden clustering algorithm which assigns a weight to each correlation (as opposed
to simply assigning an edge). This is because, should there be a correlation between 2 patients, a weighted edge
will quantify the strength of this correlation, which will be useful in clustering the nodes into more statistically
meaningful communities. 


**PCC threshold**

There are various methods we can use to assign a weight to an edge. We will use the Pearson Correlation Coefficienct (PCC)
because the gene expression data is standardised (between -1 and 1) by taking the natural logarithm of the 
aboluste gene expression values. The coefficient can serve as the weight of the edge, with a minimum value being set to determine whether an edge should even exist between the 2 nodes. We will be altering this minimum value. 

**Resolution parameter (γ)**

γ scales the Expected no. of edges ↑ or ↓. We normally take it to be 1, but it can be raised or lowered. 
- **Raising γ (> 1)**: This makes it harder for 2 nodes in the same community to have an edge weight above expectation, so we end up with a larger number of small communities.
- **Lowering γ (< 1)**: Makes it easier for 2 nodes in the same community to have an edge weight above expectation, so we end up with a smaller number of large communities.

We will also be altering the value of γ.

**Finding the optimal parameters to perform Leiden Clustering**

We will be testing thresolds for the PCC from **0.6 0.7 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.91 0.92 0.93 0.94 0.95 0.96**.  
For the Resolution parameter, we will be using values of **0.1 - 2, with increments of 0.1**.

We ran the Leiden Clustering algorithm (for each unique pair of PCC thresholds and γ limits) for the patients who were clinically labelled. This meant that patients in gene_data (for whom no clinical labels were available) were NOT included. For each cluster we obtained, we removed communities containing less than 20 patients, as these communities were too small to offer opportunities for significant analysis.

Then, for each Leiden cluster, we listed the different communities that were obtained, stated the number of patients in each community, and gave a breakdown of how many of these patients were "Viral", "None" or "Bacterial" using the clinical labels. Patients who were diagnosed with "Bacterial & Viral" in the clinical_data were removed and in their place, the tally of Viral and Bacterial patients were each increased by 1. This explains discrepancies between the number of patients in a particular community and the total number of patients in the diagnosis breakdown of that community.

This information can be found in the **4. LeidenClusters.csv** file attached to this repository.

Now, we have produced a variety of different Leiden clusters by varying the tunable parameters. But which Cluster
is "optimum"? And what do we mean by that? An optimum Leiden cluster is where each community contains patients with the same diagnosis, and with each community containing a sizeable number of nodes (indicating that the "diagnosis" of these nodes may be correlated to the fact that they were all clustered into the same community). We define 2 metrics which helps us determine the optimum Louvain clustering parameters.

- **Percentage of nodes in communities**: We want our Leiden cluster to produce large communities.
  Therefore, any communities < 20 have been removed. 
  
- **Weighted purity in these communities**: Ideally, we'd like all the nodes within each community to be identical to one 
  another i.e. high purity with regards to the _micro_diagnosis_ label of each node (patient). For each community, the purity 
  is the fraction of nodes that belong to the largest clinical label (if a community has 100 nodes and 80 of them are labeled 
  “None,” the purity is 80%).

  We want to also ensure that we adjust for size (for example, if Community A has 200 nodes and has a purity of 85%,
  whilst community B has a purity of 90% but a size of 100 nodes, then the increased size of A should be considered when
  calculating the overall purity).

  So, we develop the following formula for WP: **[ (Size_A × Purity_A) + (Size_B × Purity_B) ] / Size_A + Size_B**

And consequently, we develop the following graphs, which allows us to track how these 2 metrics change as we vary the PCC threshold and resolution limit parameter.

Looking at these 2 plots, we can see that as the PCC threshold is made less stringent, the percentage of nodes captured in communities > 4 rises (with resolution limit seemingly having no bearing on this metric). From the second graph, we see that increasing PCC increases the Weighted Purity, which remains quite stable regardless of the resolution parameter until we get to PCC 0.95. 

We want the PCC and threshold which maximises WP and %, and the best combination seems to be a **PCC of 0.95** along with a **resolution limit of 0.6**. So we will be going ahead with this.

**NOTE**: If I were to implement a PCC of 0.96, the percentage of total nodes captured in communities would be consistently < 30 irrespect of the resolution limit, which is why we have not "tested" it.
