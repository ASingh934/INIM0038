**K-means clustering - Data Preparation**
We now try to use K-means to cluster our patients, and determine if this clustering is in any way correlated to the 
micro-diagnosis of the patients. To prepare the dataset for K-means clustering, genes that showed 0 variation across
the patients in clinical_data were removed. The gene-expression values were then standardised, otherwise genes on larger
scales would dominate distance calculations. 

**Dealing with convergence to local minima**
In K-means clustering, for a given K-value, the algorithm tries to find the optimum clusters which _globally_ minimises
the WSS (Distance function). Unfortunately, due to random initialisation of cluster centroids, the algorithm can often 
converge to _local_ instead of _global_ minima. To combat this, I set _nstart = 25_ in my code, which instructs the 
algorithm to perform 25 independent initializations and retain the solution that achieves the lowest overall WSS, 
thereby improving robustness and increasing the likelihood of identifying a near-global optimum.

**Finding the optimum K-value**
K-means clustering was performed for K values ranging from 1 - 15. For each K-value, the lowest obtained WSS was 
plotted, yielding an elbow plot. However, we can not notice any distinct "elbow", so we need other metrics to 
determine an optimum K-value.
