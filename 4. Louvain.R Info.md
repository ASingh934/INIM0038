**Louvain Clustering**

Louvain clustering is a graph-based algorithm which clusters **nodes** into tightly-packed clusters called **communities**.
It does this via a repetitive iteration of modularity optimisation, followed by community aggregation, until it has
achieved _**maximum modularity**_. Modularity is a measure of _how much more / less intra-community connectivity exists 
compared to a random network_. It is denoted by Q, and Q ranges between **-0.5 < Q < 1**.

In this code, we will be using a Louvain clustering algorithm which assigns a weight to each correlation (as opposed
to simply assigning an edge). This is because, should there be a correlation between 2 patients, a weighted edge
will quantify the strength of this correlation, which will be useful in clustering the nodes into more statistically
meaningful communities. 

**How can we assign a weight to an edge?**

There are various methods we can use to assign a weight to an edge. The 2 that are most relevant are:

- Pearson Correlation coefficient
- Spearman Rank Correlation coefficient
  
The coefficient can serve as the weight of the edge, with a minimum value being set to determine whether an edge should even exist between the 2 nodes. We will be altering this minimum value. 

**Resolution parameter (γ)**

γ scales the Expected no. of edges ↑ or ↓. We normally take it to be 1, but it can be raised or lowered. 
- **Raising γ (> 1)**: This makes it harder for 2 nodes in the same community to have an edge weight above expectation, so we end up with a larger number of small communities.
- **Lowering γ (< 1)**: Makes it easier for 2 nodes in the same community to have an edge weight above expectation, so we end up with a smaller number of large communities.

We will also be altering the value of γ.

So, all in all, we have covered some tunable parameters.

**Varying these parameters**

We will be using various thresholds for the PCC and SCC (**0.9 - 0.95
, with increments of 0.01**).

For the Resolution parameter, we will be using values of **0 - 1, with increments of 0.25**. We will not be increasing γ above 1 since at these values for γ, the modularity of the Louvain cluster falls to 0 and the number of communities becomes 500 (the number of patients). So it offers no valuable insights.
