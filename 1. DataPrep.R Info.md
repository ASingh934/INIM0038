**DataPrep.R**

This R script contains the code which prepares the gene expression data for processing. The _**gene_data**_ is transposed to ensure that the row names match the patient IDs, and the column names match the gene names. The non-protein coding genes are filtered out with a CSV file containing the gene names and their corresponding biotypes. Patient grouping is then performed - there are 4 categories of patients: Oxford, UCL, UHB and Controls. The code merges the first 3 groups into a singular BioAID group.

It is assumed that all BioAID patients have ARIs, whilst all controls are healthy. 
The clinical_data contains the final confirmatory diagnosis of all Oxford and UCL patients (not the Controls or UHB patients).

Edit: I have also sifted through the clinical_data dataframe. Not all patients in gene_data are in clinical_data i.e.
their clinical labels are not available, so for the patients whose clinical labels ARE available, I have stored their 
patient IDs (as listed in gene_data) in the variable matched_patient_ids
