We have obtained an optimum Leiden cluster (PCC threshold = 0.95, resolution limit = 1.1). This cluster yielded 4 communities, 
and the patient IDs and micro_diagnosis of each member in these communities has been stored in a .csv file. Using this information,
we will now perform **Deep Dive Analysis**. No Deep Dive Analysis will be performed on the optimum K-means cluster simply
because the obtained Kappa concordance statistic was too low (roughly 0.3).

**Sensitivity and Specificity**

Among the 4 communities produced, Community 1 yielded the largest number of Viral patients. So, we assume that the Leiden
Clustering is a diagnostic test, with the categorisation of a patient into community 1 being a positive result, and the
categorisation of a patient into either communities 2, 3 or 4 being classed as a negative result. We subsequently
calculate the sensitivity and specificity of this diagnostic test (assuming that our micro_diagnosis labels are 
completely accurate). Here are our results:

- **Sensitivity: 0.702**
- **Specificity: 0.823**
