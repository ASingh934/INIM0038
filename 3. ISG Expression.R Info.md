MX1, IFI27 and IFI44L are **Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISGs)**, whose expression is upregulated in response to 
_Type I interferons_ produced during viral infections. We will anayse the gene expression data of each patient, focusing
on these 3 ISGs in particular.

We first extract the gene expression data of each control. We assume that all controls do NOT have an ARI, and therefore
there is no upregulation in the expression of their ISGs. Therefore, the mean and standard deviation of their expression
values for MX1, IFI27 and IFI44L are calculated. This serves as the basis for calculating the Z-scores for each gene 
(biomarker). For Controls whose gene expression is above **Q3 + 1.5 * IQR** , they are considered outliers and therefore, 
their gene expression value for that particular ISG is exluded from the mean and SD calculations. For each ISG, outlier
controls have been excluded from the plots.

We can now standardize every patient's gene expression values using the mean and standard deviation.
For example, if the mean expression of MX1 in controls is **MX1_μ** and the standard deviation is **MX1_σ**, we plug in
every patient's gene expression value (**MX1_Value**) for MX1 into the following equation:

**Z-score for MX1 = ( MX1_Value - MX1_μ ) / MX1_σ**

We plotted all of these patients on a box plot, for each of these 3 genes. The patients were categorised into 2 groups:
controls (who served as the basis for Z score calculations), and the BioAID patients.

The mean Z score for all the controls for each gene was 0.
**NOTE**: The central line of the box plot represents the median, not the mean.

Now, using the Biomarker papers I read, we assume that the threshold for a signficantly increased expression of the ISGs
is |Z| > 2. So, we hypothesize that for BioAID patients whose gene expression value exceeds 2 i.e. Z > 2, they will have
a viral infection. Testing this out. I then incorporate the clinical labels for the BioAID patients. Some BioAID patients do 
not have clinical labels, so they are removed from the Boxplots, but for that do, they are subdivided into 4 categories.
Their box-plots are shown here.

We can clearly see that the biomarker Z scores for BioAID patients with viral ARIs are elevated when compared to those
without viral ARIs. This pattern was also replicated in histogram and density plots made using the clinically labelled 
BioAID patients (in these plots, I removed the Bacterial & Viral grouping since only 2 patients in the clinical_data
were diagnosed dually with bacterial and viral infection, and this extra group was cluttering these plots).

**Histogram**

And finally, just to quantify these findings, I calculated the AUROC values for each ISG to assign a numerical
value to how well each ISG differentiated between Viral and Non-viral patients.

We can see that each ISG had an AUROC value of > 0.8, which means these ISGs are excellent, giving 
alot of confidence to the hypothesis that a higher ISG expression means an increased likelihood
of the patient being Viral.
