**K-means clustering - Data Preparation**

We now try to use K-means to cluster our patients, and determine if this clustering is in any way correlated to the 
micro-diagnosis of the patients. To prepare the dataset for K-means clustering, genes that showed 0 variation across
the patients in clinical_data were removed. The gene-expression values were then standardised, otherwise genes on larger
scales would dominate distance calculations. 

**Dealing with convergence to local minima**

In K-means clustering, for a given K-value, the algorithm tries to find the optimum clusters which _globally_ minimises
the WSS (Distance function). Unfortunately, due to random initialisation of cluster centroids, the algorithm can often 
converge to _local_ instead of _global_ minima. To combat this, I set _nstart = 25_ in my code, which instructs the 
algorithm to perform 25 independent initializations and retain the solution that achieves the lowest overall WSS, 
thereby improving robustness and increasing the likelihood of identifying a near-global optimum.

**Finding the optimum K-value**

K-means clustering was performed for K values ranging from 1 - 15. For each K-value, the lowest obtained WSS was 
plotted, yielding an elbow plot. However, we do not notice any distinct "elbow", so we need other metrics to 
determine an optimum K-value.

These metrics are the same we used in determining the optimum Leiden cluster:

- **Retention rate**: The percentage of patients retained when groups < 20 were removed from each cluster.
  
- **Kapaa Concordant statistic for Viral patients**: For each K value, the cluster with the largest number of Viral
  patients is designated the Viral cluster, and the remaining clusters (all of which contain a minimum of 20 patients)
  are amalgamated into a non-Viral group. The clinical labels are again used as the Gold Standard.

- **Weighted purity**: Identical to the WP metric used in Leiden clustering.

We develop the following graphs which tracks how these metrics change as the K-value changes.

Our optimum K-value is one in which over 80% of patients are captured in communities > 20 (retention rate > 80).
Provided the fulfillment of this criteria, we choose the K-value which yields the highest Kappa statistic. If there
are multiple K-values yielding Kappa values within 0.05 of the top ranked K value, then the K-value yielding clusters 
with the highest WP is chosen to be the _optimum_. We therefore determine the optimun to be **K = 9**, which has a:
- Kappa statistic: 0.3
- Retention rate: 97.51%
- Weighted Purity: 0.672
